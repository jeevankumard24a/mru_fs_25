      The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim
      Berners-Lee.[15][16] He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line
      Mode Browser, which displayed web pages on dumb terminals.[17] The Mosaic
      web browser was released in April 1993, and was later credited as the
      first web browser to find mainstream popularity.[18][19] Its innovative
      graphical user interface made the World Wide Web easy to navigate and thus
      more accessible to the average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet
      boom of the 1990s, when the Web grew at a very rapid rate.[19]

      The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which
      released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994. Navigator
      quickly became the most popular browser.[20] Microsoft debuted Internet
      Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. Within a few
      years, Microsoft gained a dominant position in the browser market for two
      reasons: it bundled Internet Explorer with its popular Windows operating
      system and did so as freeware with no restrictions on usage. The market
      share of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in the early 2000s.[21] In
      1998, Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create
      a new browser using the open-source software model. This work evolved into
      the Firefox browser, first released by Mozilla in 2004. Firefox's market
      share peaked at 32% in 2010.[22] Apple released its Safari browser in
      2003; it remains the dominant browser on Apple devices, though it did not
      become popular elsewhere.[23] Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008,
      which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the
      most popular browser in 2012.[24][25] Chrome has remained dominant ever
      since.[1] In 2015, Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge [Legacy]
      for the Windows 10 release.[26] In 2020, this legacy version was replaced
      by a new Chromium-based version of Edge. Since the early 2000s, browsers
      have greatly expanded their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia
      capabilities. One reason has been to enable more sophisticated websites,
      such as web apps. Another factor is the significant increase of broadband
      connectivity in many parts of the world, enabling people to access
      data-intensive content, such as streaming HD video on YouTube, that was
      not possible during the era of dial-up modems.[27] As an extension of
      these facilities for creating web-based applications, web browsers started
      adding support for progressive web applications (PWAs) in 2016. The term
      progressive web application was coined by Google engineer Alex Russell in
      2015.[28] PWAs have become a popular form of application that take
      advantage of modern web browser features but that can be installed and
      launched like a native application, can be used when the user's device is
      offline, and can be accessed without the user needing to enter the
      application's URL.

      PWAs offer automatic multi-platform support and smaller install sizes than
      native applications. The Apple iPhone added support for installable PWAs
      in 2018, and most major browsers support PWAs on desktop and mobile.[29]
      Features The most popular browsers share many features in common. They
      automatically log users' browsing history, unless the users turn off their
      browsing history or use the non-logging private mode. They also allow
      users to set bookmarks, customize the browser with extensions, and manage
      their downloads[30] and passwords.[31] Some provide a sync service[32] and
      web accessibility features.[33]

    <h1>Cat and 1 — A Fairytale Moment</h1>

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Hey Cat… what would you do to me if I married you?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    <span class="narration"
      >Looks into her eyes… their gaze locks. Cat smiles softly.</span
    >

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Blushing) Chi... not that, silly!<br />
    Tell me properly. What would you really do?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Okay... here’s the list...
    <ul>
      <li>
        I’ll say “I love you” at least 10 to 20 times a day — because once will
        never be enough.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ll cook for you and feed you with my own hands, every single day.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ll never miss a single moment to look at you — not just to admire your
        beauty… But to gather data for the poems you bring out of my heart.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I’m actually good at giving massages…<br />
    So, if you’re ever tired — I’ll help you relax.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Oh really? Where did you learn that?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    When I was a little overweight,<br />
    I joined a Naturopathy Ashram for a month.<br />
    That’s where I learned the art of healing touch.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    So you’ll give me a massage…?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Yes… a full body massage.

    <span class="narration"
      >(Their eyes meet. Cat smiles. 1 looks away, blushing deeply.)</span
    >

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Idiot…

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    And once a week, I’ll dress you up like an angel…<br />
    From head to toe, I’ll adorn you myself — with all my love poured into every
    delicate touch.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    From head to toe? You’ll adorn me?<br />
    What does that even mean?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    It means… on that day, everything you wear — every single thing — will be
    put on by me.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Eyes widening) Everything???

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    (Softly smiling) Yes… everything you’re thinking.<br />
    I’ll do it all — lovingly.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Blushing hard) Chi... Chi... Chi...

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I’ll paint your nails — hands and feet — carefully.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    You even know how to do that?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    No… but I’ll learn. Just to see you smile.<br />
    I’ll pick the perfect earrings… Gently put them on, one by one.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    What kind of earrings?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I love the long, dangling ones…<br />
    But we’ll pick the ones that match your dress — together.<br />
    I’ll even choose a nose ring — delicate and beautiful — and place it
    gently.<br />
    I’ll comb your hair too.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Oh really? Do you even know how to comb a girl’s hair?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I don’t… but I’ll learn.<br />
    And I’ll do it slowly, carefully… like your hair is made of silk.<br />
    I’ll place fresh flowers in your hair, with a lovely clip to hold them just
    right.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Flowers? Hah… maybe goats will start following me to eat them!

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    (Laughing, then warmly smiling) Shut up… my only silly girl.

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I’ll apply your lipstick — softly, with steady hands.<br />
    Draw your kajal — so your eyes shine like stars.<br />
    Do your makeup — even if not perfect — with all the love I have.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Do you even know how to do makeup?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Not yet… but I’ll learn. For you, I’ll try anything.<br />
    Then comes the necklace — simple, elegant, matching your dress.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Every week you’re going to buy me a new necklace?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Yes.<br />
    And if I can’t afford a real one, I’ll find a beautiful duplicate.<br />
    Because no matter what, you’ll always look like the most precious jewel in
    the world.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Blushing, giggling) Deal accepted… my jewel-loving Cat.

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Now let me tell you more...<br />
    I will put Korinktaku…

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Can you put any design?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    No no, not any!<br />
    I’ll put the moon, surrounded by four circles,<br />
    on your feet and your hands — like a secret spell… only I understand.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Next…?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    My favorite… are Anklets.<br />
    I’ll buy every design ever made — every jingling treasure in the world, just
    for you.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    Why are Anklets your favorite?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I always wear earbuds to listen to music.<br />
    But with your Anklets… I won’t need them anymore.<br />
    Because they’ll sing sweeter music than any song I’ve ever heard.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    What’s so special about Anklet music?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    It’s magical.<br />
    They don’t just make sound — they call my name through their melody.<br />
    So if you’re in the kitchen — I’ll come.<br />
    If you’re in the hallway — I’ll come.<br />
    If you’re in . . . I will Come …

    <span class="narration"
      >(Their eyes meet again. Cat smiles. 1 blushes deeply.)</span
    >

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat (whispers):</span>
    Your Anklets…<br />
    They’ll be my new Morning alarm clock — Waking me from sleep …

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Next, I’ll help you into elegant medium heels — stylish, yet comfortable.<br />
    Because you’re my queen.<br />
    Of course, a matching handbag — to complete your perfect look.<br />
    Then… we’ll step out into the world — Hand in hand.<br />
    I’ll take so many pictures of you — every smile, every sparkle, every
    glance.<br />
    Because every second with you is a moment worth capturing.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    And what will you do with all those pictures?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    I’ll pick the most beautiful ones.<br />
    And for each one, I’ll write a poem —<br />
    To capture your soul, your smile, that exact moment.<br />
    At the end of the year, I’ll gather them — Photos and poems — and make a
    book.<br />
    A book all about you.<br />
    I’ll publish it — so the world knows how beautiful you are —<br />
    Not just outside, but in every heartbeat, every breath, and every laugh.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Softly) What’s the name of the book?

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    (Smiling warmly)<br />
    “Ashuuu – The Fairytale.”<br />
    Volume 1… Volume 2… and so on.<br />
    One volume every year —<br />
    Because each year with you is a new chapter in our magical love story.

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    And when we get home...<br />
    I’ll slowly and gently remove everything I put on you — piece by piece, with
    care.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Eyes widening) Everything??

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    (Smirking softly) Yes… everything.

    <span class="speaker one">1:</span>
    (Blushing deeply, turning away) Shut up, Sachinoda...

    <span class="narration"
      >She walks off, still smiling, cheeks glowing red.</span
    >

    <span class="speaker cat">Cat:</span>
    Calling out playfully — "Vasaaaiiiiiiii Bujji Thalliiiiiiii..."

    <span class="narration"
      >He follows her, heart full of love, and then softly reads:</span
    >
